# Eyes
## Project description:
This project is an exercise on applying styles programmatically using event listeners. In the starter code for this activity, the mouse movement event was used to update the position of the "eyeball" element displayed on the page. My task was to add a second "eye" element and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.

## How to run:
Move the mouse across the screen and watch the eye following the mouse movement

## Roadmap:
- A nice extension would be to add an eyelid and make it blink when the mouse is clicked.
- We add some objects in different places on the screen an display the object name when the eye is looking in that object direction.
